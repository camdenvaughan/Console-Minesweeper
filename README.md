# Console Minesweeper
A recreation of minesweeper running in the windows command prompt. It includes all the normal gameplay and functionality of minesweeper with ASCII art in the command console. 

# Controls:

- Select difficulty with number keys.

- Navigate minefield with arrow keys.

- Flag a square with 'f'.

- select a square with 'Enter'.

# How to Play:

Start off by selecting any square, your first square will never be a bomb, or have any adjacent bombs.

Then notice the numbers. A square that is a number means that in the surrounding 8 squares, there is that many bombs. So a 1 means in the surrounding 8 squares, there is 1 bomb.

Squares that are believed to be bombs can be flagged using f, this is done to help the player in remembering what is a bomb and to avoid accidental selection but flagging is completely optional.

The game is won by selecting all of the squares that are not bombs.

Good Luck!

*If you have never played minesweeper, I recommend starting with a version that is not created with the constraints of the command prompt as it will be easier to see and understand. I recommend trying <a href="https://www.minesweeperonline.com/">here</a>.
